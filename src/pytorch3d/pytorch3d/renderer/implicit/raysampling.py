This file defines three raysampling techniques:

    - NDCMultinomialRaysampler which can be used to sample rays from pixels of an image grid,
        which follows the pytorch3d convention for image grid coordinates
    - MonteCarloRaysampler which randomly selects real-valued locations in the image plane
        and emits rays from them

class MultinomialRaysampler(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Samples a fixed number of points along rays which are regularly distributed
    in a batch of rectangular image grids. Points along each ray
    have uniformly-spaced z-coordinates between a predefined
    minimum and maximum depth.

    The raysampler first generates a 3D coordinate grid of the following form::

           / min_x, min_y, max_depth -------------- / max_x, min_y, max_depth
          /                                        /|

        max_y ----------------------------- max_x/ min_depth         v
                < --- image_width --- >

    In order to generate ray points, `MultinomialRaysampler` takes each 3D point of
    the grid (with coordinates `[x, y, depth]`) and unprojects it
    with `cameras.unproject_points([x, y, depth])`, where `cameras` are an
    additional input to the `forward` function.

    Note that this is a generic implementation that can support any image grid
    coordinate convention. For a raysampler which follows the PyTorch3D
    coordinate conventions please refer to `NDCMultinomialRaysampler`.
    As such, `NDCMultinomialRaysampler` is a special case of `MultinomialRaysampler`.
