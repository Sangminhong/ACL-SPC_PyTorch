class AbstractMaskRaySampler(RaySamplerBase, torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Samples a fixed number of points along rays which are in turn sampled for
    each camera in a batch.

    This class utilizes `NDCMultinomialRaysampler` which allows to either
    randomly sample rays from an input foreground saliency mask
    (`RenderSamplingMode.MASK_SAMPLE`), or on a rectangular image grid
    (`RenderSamplingMode.FULL_GRID`). The sampling mode can be set separately
    for training and evaluation by setting `self.sampling_mode_training`
    and `self.sampling_mode_training` accordingly.

    The class allows to adjust the sampling points along rays by overwriting the
    `AbstractMaskRaySampler._get_min_max_depth_bounds` function which returns
    the near/far planes (`min_depth`/`max_depth`) `NDCMultinomialRaysampler`.

    Settings:
        image_width: The horizontal size of the image grid.
        image_height: The vertical size of the image grid.
        sampling_mode_training: The ray sampling mode for training. This should be a str
            option from the RenderSamplingMode Enum
        sampling_mode_evaluation: Same as above but for evaluation.
        n_pts_per_ray_training: The number of points sampled along each ray during training.
        n_pts_per_ray_evaluation: The number of points sampled along each ray during evaluation.
        n_rays_per_image_sampled_from_mask: The amount of rays to be sampled from the image
            grid. Given a batch of image grids, this many is sampled from each.
            `n_rays_per_image_sampled_from_mask` and `n_rays_total_training` cannot both be
            defined.
        n_rays_total_training: (optional) How many rays in total to sample from the entire
            batch of provided image grid. The result is as if `n_rays_total_training`
            cameras/image grids were sampled with replacement from the cameras / image grids
            provided and for every camera one ray was sampled.
            `n_rays_per_image_sampled_from_mask` and `n_rays_total_training` cannot both be
            defined, to use you have to set `n_rays_per_image` to None.
            Used only for EvaluationMode.TRAINING.
        stratified_point_sampling_training: if set, performs stratified random sampling
            along the ray; otherwise takes ray points at deterministic offsets.
